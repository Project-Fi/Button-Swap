# Button Swap
taiHEN plugin for swapping X and O buttons on PSVita

Installation
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Put "buttonswap.suprx" in 'tai' folder in the root of your Vita.

Change config.txt in that directory to load plugin for title of your choice by adding new lines like below:

```text
# titleid for your game (this one is for Root//Letter for example)
*PCSB01019
ux0:tai/buttonswap.suprx
```

After that just run the game and your buttons should be swapped (this would work only for this game).
